To get started:
1. Drop this "Map 3d" folder in "H:\". Changing this location could break stuff
2. Open "Map 3d\Documentation.html", and follow the instructions under "Workspace Setup".
3. Ready to go! Now you can learn Lisp and Powershell, and familiarize yourself with Sublime Text 3 (A text editor. It's super useful and way better than notepad).
