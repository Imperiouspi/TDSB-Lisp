1. Move and Align all drawings
	a) run FIXUNITS
	b) set coordinate systems in both the drawing and the plugin.
	b) open ESRI image
	c) if upper floor, xref lower floor in
	d) align to lower floor or ESRI image.
	Troubleshooting: if a lower floor imports in the wrong location, and the coordinate system AND units are set correctly in both, then I don't know what's wrong, and put the school into the "Problems" folder.
2. Move into "edited by Noah" (if there was no problem)
3. Run script in "sort files.ps1"
4. Mergecad drawings into floor_X files from sub folders
5. remove drawings from subfolders back into "edited by Noah"
6. Run script in "SortToRedraw.ps1", filters files that are in the redraw process (they can be ignored)
7. Run script in "next folder.ps1", copies files that have the same name into their proper places in "Record Drawing Master Files"
8. Uncomment Manual Move section in "next folder.ps1" to help manually check each remaining school in "edited by Noah"
