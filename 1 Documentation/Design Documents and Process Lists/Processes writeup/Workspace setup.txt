Workspace setup
1. AutoCAD
	a) Options>Files>Support File Search Path, add the folder that contains acaddoc.lsp.
	b) To load new lisp files, drag and drop onto the window or use the LOAD command, or add into acaddoc.lsp as another (load "filename")
2. Sublime Text
	a) An installation of sublime text 3 is included in this folder. It comes preinstalled with a few packages I found useful (explore them yourself).
	b) It comes pre-configured with a keyboard shortcut to generate documentation (alt+d), and run the currently edited powershell script (alt+r)
