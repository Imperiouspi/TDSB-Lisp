Autogen clockwise:
Option 1: Follow outline in spiral
	1. Select Outline object
	2. Get slope of line, follow to next object
	3. Inner objects: ??
Option 2: Whirlwind Select
	1. Divide into quandrants.
	2. Find entrance. 
	3. If more than one object still present in quandrant, Go to step 1 with the entrance quandrant
	4. Label object, move to next clockwise quandrant
	5. What will this actually do? Might catch ends of peninsulas or centers rather than edge first
Option 3: Just clockwise
	1. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6989100/sort-points-in-clockwise-order# for algorithm.
