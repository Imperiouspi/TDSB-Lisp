Contains all lisp routines written by Noah Cassidy from September 2018 until August 2019. All useful functions are loaded by acaddoc.lsp. "Original Site Plan Lisp" contains functions to help label roof ids, but all useful utilites in there are loaded through site_plan_utils in acaddoc. Development was moved to the refactored library in November, and useful functions were copied into "utils.lsp". Documentation ongoing.
